          Your courage, wit, and unbreakable mind have amazed even the wisest
          guardians of Ellaria.<br />
        </p>
        <p>
          Thanks to you, the Feather of Krechet has been filled with the power
          of the four elements again.<br />
          The sages, freed from the spell of ominous darkness, used powerful
          spells and destroyed Ruin. <br />
          The magic book has been saved.<br />
          The balance between the worlds has been restored.

          And now it is time to return to your world... <br />But you are no
          longer the person you were before.<br />In your heart is courage.
          <br />In your soul is wisdom. <br />And in every step you take — the
          light that you bring to others.
          <br />
          Follow the paths of life with dignity and courage, as you did in time
          spaces. Give goodness, support and hope to everyone around you. And
          never forget: the power of one person's goodness, combined with the
          goodness of others — even from other worlds — is capable of saving the
          Universe. Because the real world is connected with the magical… And
          the magical — with the real.
