        Dear friend! <br />Welcome to the Magical World of Ellaria!<br />
        Ellaria is our fairyland, powered by the energy of kind hearts from your
        real world. We cannot exist without each other.<br />
        But the balance is broken... The Dark Force has awakened and threatens
        to erase Ellaria from the face of the dimension. All hope is only in
        you...<br />

          The wise men of our world suddenly disappeared and the fire of the
          Book of Life went out.<br />
          The Feather of Krechet is an artifact created by the mighty
          bird-dragon Krechet, a being who once united light and darkness. It
          was with his Feather that the wise men of our world wrote protective
          spells in the Magic Book of Life - a source of wisdom, harmony and
          strength.<br />
          Noticing the threat, they managed to disperse the power of the Feather
          between the four Guardians - the Goddesses of Earth, Water, Wind and
          Fire.<br />Only the one who passes their tests will be able to collect
          parts of the power, restore the Feather and stop the darkness.

        The evil Ruin has long dreamed that one day he would be able to take
        over our world and commit atrocities in your world.<br />
        Hoping to be able to take over the Feather of Krechet, he kidnapped our
        sages.<br />
        But he did not know that the power of the universe follows the balance
        and when threatened with destruction, the Feather loses its magical
        power.<br />
        Now the Feather of Krechet is waiting for the return of its magical
        properties and reunion with the sages to create the most powerful spell
        against Ruin.<br />

        worlds!<br />

        reach the Goddesses Guardians of the four elements: Nedrianna Mirra
        (Goddess of Earth), Vodelia Silva (Goddess of Water), Palanna Ardent
        (Goddess of Fire) and Vitrelia Bollei (Goddess of Wind).<br />
        You will need to take turns passing the tests of the Goddesses for
        observation, intelligence and intelligence.<br />
        Legend has it that only the worthy will be able to restore the power of
        Per Krechet.<br />
